# Lepton Alfred Workflow
This Workflow provides an easy way to trigger a new search inside [Lepton app](http://hackjutsu.com/Lepton/). Lepton is a gist/snippets manager available for MacOS, Windows and Linux.

The main purpose of this workflow is to agilize the process of finding gists inside Lepton. Without this you need to open Lepton, press a keyboard shortcut to trigger a search and type your search terms. With this workflow you can just open Alfred, type `gist search-term` and press enter.
